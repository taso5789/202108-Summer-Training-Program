# codes I used in a summer training program, which trys to analyze the impact of people's social recognition ranges on marriage rates.
# In general, as people's social recognition ranges widen, marriage rate are expected to decline because people can see better opposite sex easily.
# For example, you can see more beautiful women in SNS easily than women you can contact in your real daily life.
# Therefore, it is possible that you hesitate to marry someone you can meet in your daily life.
